# phpls-rs
This is going to become a language server for PHP, written in Rust. WIP my friends, be patient!

This file will of course be extended once I have something that actually runs :)
The code is still pretty messy as I am still rather new to Rust and am trying to find a good style. Will be cleaned up at some point.

First priority is to support:

* Code completion
* Rename symbol
* Go to definition
* Go to usages
* Go to implementations

And it should be fast. Like ... really fast. Like "not getting in your way when you work on a large codebase" fast.
